**Weekly recording:**

Based on the concept of week 5, I decided to design a scale, then I drew a sketch. Actually, the first sketch for the appearance looked like a box which did not have any connections with my concept, so I decided to change the appearance. On the process, then I get another one. (see the right picture)
