**Weekly diary:**

**Week 6:**

Based on the concept of week 5, I decided to design a scale, then I drew a sketch. Actually, the first sketch for the appearance looked like a box which did not have any connections with my concept, so I decided to change the appearance. On the process, then I get another one. (see the right picture)

Additionally, I tried to connect the circuit and research how to use some of different sensors. I decided to use Tinkercad to connect them because it can make sure whether it had some problems on the coding. First of all, I tried to link each sensor individually (two servos, two pressures, a distance and a LCD screen).

Then I wrote the status machine which is when the audiences close the installation, distance sensor can check, light will high, servo will go to 30 degrees and LCD will show some words. And then, the audiences can take something on the left and right tray, the pressure will sense and servo will go to 180 degrees. The next step is that audiences take two different things on the both trays, The first tray to 180 degrees will go to 0 degrees and the other tray will go to 180, then delay a moment, they will swap and loop. On the process, the LCD will change different content.

To make sure the status machine, I started to combine these sensors. On the first step, I combined the LCD, light and distance because I thought they were easier then the pressure and servo. Then I combined the coding and connect the circuit and add a if in it. Then I tried to combined the pressure and servo, and add 4 ‘if’ in coding. At last, I combined them together but I have no idea how can I combine the so many ‘if’.

After trying many time and numerous errors, I decided to use the distance sensor as the the first if, and then wrote the other ‘if’ in the else.

**Week 7:**

When I make sure the coding did not has any problems. I decided to make a 3D model because I want to use 3D print to print the it. I thought there are some of complicated structures on the modal, so 3D print was a better choice I believed. Actually, it is not an easy thing though it just combined by some of different geometries. I needed to consider how can I make a right route to put the wires in, how big do I want to do and how thick do I want to do?
