**Weekly recording:**

Based on the concept of week 5, I decided to design a scale, then I drew a sketch. Actually, the first sketch for the appearance looked like a box which did not have any connections with my concept, so I decided to change the appearance. On the process, then I get another one. (see the right picture)

Additionally, I tried to connect the circuit and research how to use some of different sensors. I decided to use Tinkercad to connect them because it can make sure whether it had some problems on the coding. First of all, I tried to link each sensor individually (two servos, two pressures, a distance and a LCD screen).
